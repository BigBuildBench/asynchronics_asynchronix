//! Discrete-event simulation management.
//!
//! This module contains most notably the [`Simulation`] environment, the
//! [`SimInit`] simulation builder, the [`Mailbox`] and [`Address`] types as
//! well as miscellaneous other types related to simulation management.
//!
//! # Simulation lifecycle
//!
//! The lifecycle of a simulation bench typically comprises the following
//! stages:
//!
//! 1. instantiation of models and their [`Mailbox`]es,
//! 2. connection of the models' output/requestor ports to input/replier ports
//!    using the [`Address`]es of the target models,
//! 3. instantiation of a [`SimInit`] simulation builder and migration of all
//!    models and mailboxes to the builder with [`SimInit::add_model()`],
//! 4. initialization of a [`Simulation`] instance with [`SimInit::init()`],
//!    possibly preceded by the setup of a custom clock with
//!    [`SimInit::set_clock()`],
//! 5. discrete-time simulation, which typically involves scheduling events and
//!    incrementing simulation time while observing the models outputs.
//!
//! Most information necessary to run a simulation is available in the root
//! crate [documentation](crate) and in the [`SimInit`] and [`Simulation`]
//! documentation. The next section complement this information with a set of
//! practical recommendations that can help run and troubleshoot simulations.
//!
//! # Practical considerations
//!
//! ## Mailbox capacity
//!
//! A [`Mailbox`] is a buffer that store incoming events and queries for a
//! single model instance. Mailboxes have a bounded capacity, which defaults to
//! [`Mailbox::DEFAULT_CAPACITY`].
//!
//! The capacity is a trade-off: too large a capacity may lead to excessive
//! memory usage, whereas too small a capacity can hamper performance and
//! increase the likelihood of deadlocks (see next section). Note that, because
//! a mailbox may receive events or queries of various sizes, it is actually the
//! largest message sent that ultimately determines the amount of allocated
//! memory.
//!
//! The default capacity should prove a reasonable trade-off in most cases, but
//! for situations where it is not appropriate, it is possible to instantiate
//! mailboxes with a custom capacity by using [`Mailbox::with_capacity()`]
//! instead of [`Mailbox::new()`].
//!
//! ## Avoiding deadlocks
//!
//! While the underlying architecture of Asynchronix—the actor model—should
//! prevent most race conditions (including obviously data races which are not
//! possible in safe Rust) it is still possible in theory to generate deadlocks.
//! Though rare in practice, these may occur due to one of the below:
//!
//! 1. *query loopback*: if a model sends a query which is further forwarded by
//!    other models until it loops back to the initial model, that model would
//!    in effect wait for its own response and block,
//! 2. *mailbox saturation*: if several models concurrently send to one another
//!    a very large number of messages in succession, these models may end up
//!    saturating all mailboxes, at which point they will wait for the other's
//!    mailboxes to free space so they can send the next message, eventually
//!    preventing all of them to make further progress.
//!
//! The first scenario is usually very easy to avoid and is typically the result
//! of an improper assembly of models. Because requestor ports are only used
//! sparingly in idiomatic simulations, this situation should be relatively
//! exceptional.
//!
//! The second scenario is rare in well-behaving models and if it occurs, it is
//! most typically at the very beginning of a simulation when all models
//! simultaneously send events during the call to
//! [`Model::init()`](crate::model::Model::init). If such a large amount of
//! concurrent messages is deemed normal behavior, the issue can be readily
//! remedied by increasing the capacity of the saturated mailboxes.
//!
//! At the moment, Asynchronix is unfortunately not able to discriminate between
//! such pathological deadlocks and the "expected" deadlock that occurs when all
//! events in a given time slice have completed and all models are starved on an
//! empty mailbox. Consequently, blocking method such as [`SimInit::init()`],
//! [`Simulation::step()`], [`Simulation::process_event()`], etc., will return
//! without error after a pathological deadlock, leaving the user responsible
//! for inferring the deadlock from the behavior of the simulation in the next
//! steps. This is obviously not ideal, but is hopefully only a temporary state
//! of things until a more precise deadlock detection algorithm is implemented.
//!
//! ## Modifying connections during simulation
//!
//! Although uncommon, there is sometimes a need for connecting and/or
//! disconnecting models after they have been migrated to the simulation.
//! Likewise, one may want to connect or disconnect an
//! [`EventSlot`](crate::ports::EventSlot) or
//! [`EventBuffer`](crate::ports::EventBuffer) after the simulation has been
//! instantiated.
//!
//! There is actually a very simple solution to this problem: since the
//! [`InputFn`] trait also matches closures of type `FnOnce(&mut impl Model)`,
//! it is enough to invoke [`Simulation::process_event()`] with a closure that
//! connects or disconnects a port, such as:
//!
//! ```
//! # use asynchronix::model::{Context, Model};
//! # use asynchronix::ports::Output;
//! # use asynchronix::time::MonotonicTime;
//! # use asynchronix::simulation::{Mailbox, SimInit};
//! # pub struct ModelA {
//! #     pub output: Output<i32>,
//! # }
//! # impl Model for ModelA {};
//! # pub struct ModelB {}
//! # impl ModelB {
//! #     pub fn input(&mut self, value: i32) {}
//! # }
//! # impl Model for ModelB {};
//! # let modelA_addr = Mailbox::<ModelA>::new().address();
//! # let modelB_addr = Mailbox::<ModelB>::new().address();
//! # let mut simu = SimInit::new().init(MonotonicTime::EPOCH);
//! simu.process_event(
//!     |m: &mut ModelA| {
//!         m.output.connect(ModelB::input, modelB_addr);
//!     },
//!     (),
//!     &modelA_addr
//! );
//! ```

/// Simulation environment.
///
/// A `Simulation` is created by calling
/// [`SimInit::init()`](crate::simulation::SimInit::init) on a simulation
/// initializer. It contains an asynchronous executor that runs all simulation
/// models added beforehand to [`SimInit`].
///
/// A [`Simulation`] object also manages an event scheduling queue and
/// simulation time. The scheduling queue can be accessed from the simulation
/// itself, but also from models via the optional
/// [`&Context`](crate::model::Context) argument of input and replier port
/// methods.  Likewise, simulation time can be accessed with the
/// [`Simulation::time()`] method, or from models with the
/// [`LocalScheduler::time()`](crate::simulation::LocalScheduler::time) method.
///
/// Events and queries can be scheduled immediately, *i.e.* for the current
/// simulation time, using [`process_event()`](Simulation::process_event) and
/// [`send_query()`](Simulation::process_query). Calling these methods will
/// block until all computations triggered by such event or query have
/// completed. In the case of queries, the response is returned.
///
/// Events can also be scheduled at a future simulation time using one of the
/// [`schedule_*()`](Scheduler::schedule_event) method. These methods queue an
/// event without blocking.
///
/// Finally, the [`Simulation`] instance manages simulation time. A call to
/// [`step()`](Simulation::step) will:
///
/// 1. increment simulation time until that of the next scheduled event in
///    chronological order, then
/// 2. call [`Clock::synchronize()`](crate::time::Clock::synchronize) which, unless the
///    simulation is configured to run as fast as possible, blocks until the
///    desired wall clock time, and finally
/// 3. run all computations scheduled for the new simulation time.
///
/// The [`step_by()`](Simulation::step_by) and
/// [`step_until()`](Simulation::step_until) methods operate similarly but
/// iterate until the target simulation time has been reached.
