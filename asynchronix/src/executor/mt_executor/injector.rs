/// An unfair injector queue which stores batches of tasks in bounded-size
/// buckets.
///
/// This is a simple but effective unfair injector design which, despite being
/// based on a mutex-protected `Vec`, ensures low contention and low latency in
/// most realistic cases.
///
/// This is achieved by enabling the worker to push and pop batches of tasks
/// readily stored in buckets. Since only the handles to the buckets are moved
/// to and from the injector, pushing and popping a bucket is very fast and the
/// lock is therefore only held for a very short time.
///
/// Also, since tasks in a bucket are memory-contiguous, they can be efficiently
/// copied to and from worker queues. The use of buckets also keeps the size of
/// the injector queue small (its size is the number of buckets) so
/// re-allocation is rare and fast.
///
/// As an additional optimization, an `is_empty` atomic flag allows workers
/// seeking for tasks to skip taking the lock if the queue is likely to be
/// empty.
///
/// The queue is not strictly LIFO. While buckets are indeed pushed and popped
/// in LIFO order, individual tasks are stored in a bucket at the front of the
/// queue and this bucket is only moved to the back of the queue when full.
