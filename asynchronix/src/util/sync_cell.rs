/// In the meantime, this implementation sidesteps these issues by only dealing

/// can still be constructed and destructed even in such case.
///
/// Note that it is still possible to use a `SyncCell` for types that cannot be
/// safely constructed from a teared state: it is enough to make
/// `TearableAtomic::Value` an always-safe-to-construct builder type for the
/// actual value, and to build the actual value only when a builder is returned
/// from the `read` method since such builder is then guaranteed to be in a
/// valid state.
///
/// `SyncCell` is restricted to a single writer, which is the `SyncCell` object
/// itself. This makes it possible to increment the sequence count with simple
/// loads and stores instead of more expensive read-modify-write atomic
/// operations. It also gives the `SyncCell` object the possibility to read the
/// value at any time without any synchronization overhead. Multiple thread-safe
